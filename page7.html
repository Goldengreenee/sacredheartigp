Trenkamp's diary notes (Parish Priest from April 1908 ‚Äì November 1915), one comes across a stone-upon-stone building effort by its pastors ‚Äî slow (around 150 months to completion), but steady (from Church site to cemetery, to Presbytery, to Chapel, to School).<br>It shows an intriguing order of priorities ‚Äî a thesis building up inevitably to its antithesis (the convent), with a synthesis yet to appear over the horizon.<br><br>A chronicle of events in the building of "an altar to the Lord" at Igatpuri (or the "Cathedral of Cologne," as it was mystifyingly dubbed during the construction stage) can be set out as follows:<br><br><strong>1. June 1868</strong><br>Vicar Apostolic Bishop Meurin applied to the Government for a two-acre plot for a Church.<br>The Revenue Commissioner, W.H. Havelock, sanctioned it on 31st July 1868 for a nominal compensation of three rupees and two annas, with an annual assessment of ten annas.<br><br><strong>2. 7th May 1870</strong><br>Mr. J. Esseiva, on behalf of the resident Catholics of the G.I.P. Railway, applied for an adjoining plot measuring one acre and five and a half chains, to be used as a cemetery.<br>After three reminders, on 22nd August 1871, a three-acre, 19-gunta plot was sanctioned free of compensation, with an annual assessment of one rupee, one anna, and four pice.<br><br><strong>3. 28th February 1874</strong><br>Bishop Meurin laid the foundation stone of the Presbytery, to be built by Fr. Lau.<br>One large room of it was to be used as a temporary chapel. However, Church building work did not progress beyond the plinth due to a scarcity of funds (being generated through subscriptions and raffles).<br><br>Meanwhile, the Collector of Nasik withdrew the previously granted permission to quarry stones free of cost, since work had stopped.<br>Later, it was re-granted on the request of Fr. Egger.<br>A further concession was given to Fr. Saelinger to take sand free of cost from a Government plot ‚Äî though later, he was accused by the mamlatdar of cultivating the plot with oilseeds and nagli (finger millet).<br>In a decision worthy of King Solomon, the Collector sternly reminded the Pastor that the land could not be used for purposes other than specified but commended him nevertheless for ‚Äúbeautifying the plot by planting a garden‚Äù!<br><br><strong>4. 1880</strong><br>The roof of the Church was built.<br>It was decided to dedicate the Church to The Sacred Heart of Jesus, while calling upon St. Francis Xavier to serve as Patron Saint.<br>The formal dedication ceremony was performed on 27th February 1881 by Bishop Meurin.<br><br><strong>The Church Builders (Parish Priests)</strong><strong><br></strong><br><strong>1. Fr. A. Bodewig </strong>(28th January 1874 ‚Äì 29th October 1874)<br><br>First Parish Priest appointed to Igatpuri.<br><br>His predecessor, Fr. P.C.I. Peters, had been only a visiting pastor (from 13th December 1872), covering the Igatpuri‚ÄìBhusaval areas.<br><br>Fr. Bodewig attempted to live as a Brahmin ‚Äî a fascinating early attempt at 'Indianization', though it was deemed "unsuitable."<br><br><strong>2. Fr. Predeck</strong> (30th October 1874 ‚Äì ?)<br><br>Transferred from Bhusaval to Igatpuri.<br><br>The diary hints that this might have been related to Fr. Bodewig's experiment, but no details are recorded.<br><br>The Parish domain expanded up to Manmad in the north and Kalyan in the south.<br><br><strong>3. Fr. J. Egger</strong> (17th January 1875 ‚Äì 27th January 1876)<br><br>Started the Parish School, St. Joseph‚Äôs (1st February 1875).<br><br>Celebrated the first Mass at Kasara.<br><br>After about a year, left for his ‚Äúgreat retreat‚Äù in Bombay, resulting in frequent pastoral visitations by various priests and Bishop Meurin.<br><br><strong>4. Fr. P.H. Geron</strong> (28th January 1876 ‚Äì 13th April 1876)<br><br>Disallowed the singing of the Moteti during Holy Week, offending local Goans but pleasing Europeans.<br><br>Was recalled to Bombay after Easter.<br><br><strong>5. Fr. P. Saelinger</strong> (1st December 1876 ‚Äì 28th January 1886)<br><br>Served as Parish Priest and Chaplain at Deolali.<br><br>Completed the Church building in 1881 and installed new Stations of the Cross (18th March 1881).<br><br>Proposed the setting up of a Confraternity of the Sacred Heart, though it was not formalized.<br><br>Bishop Meurin lamented the community's "disunity," poor support for Church dues, and the failure of St. Anne's feast in 1881.<br><br><strong>6. Fr. T. Dalhoff</strong> (28th December 1886 ‚Äì 30th June 1887)<br><br>Short tenure; later became Archbishop Porter's Vicar General.<br><br><strong>7. Fr. M. Durach</strong> (1st July 1887 ‚Äì 21st April 1897)<br><br>Expanded St. Joseph‚Äôs School (up to Standard VII).<br><br>Welcomed the Sisters (11th February 1889), leading to the establishment of the Convent.<br><br>Beautified the Sanctuary with oil paintings and Gothic-style altars.<br><br><strong>8. Fr. J.B. Stein</strong> (21st April 1897 ‚Äì December 1899)<br><br>Built a new school building without Government aid, winning admiration.<br><br>Left no debts.<br><br><strong>9. Fr. George</strong> (December 1899 ‚Äì April 1901)<br><br>Suggested an appeal for international famine aid in 1899.<br><br>Converted his rose garden into a vegetable patch.<br><br>Bought 16 new benches for the Church at reduced cost.<br><br><strong>10. Fr. C. Hutmacher</strong> (1st April 1901 ‚Äì August 1902)<br><br>Enclosed the Presbytery‚Äôs verandah and planted gardens.<br><br><strong>11. Fr. H. Tillman</strong> (August 1902 ‚Äì December 1903)<br><br>Added two rooms to the kitchen.<br><br>Secured a small Government grant for rebuilding St. Joseph‚Äôs School.<br><br><strong>12. Fr. T. Peters</strong> (December 1903 ‚Äì March 1908)<br><br>Negotiated the purchase of Mayes‚Äô land (with Sisters contributing Rs. 250).<br><br>Built compound walls, repaired the Presbytery, Chapel, and School.<br><br>Faced conflict with the Nuns over student admissions.<br><br><strong>13. Fr. F. Trenkamp</strong> (April 1908 ‚Äì November 1915)<br><br>According to his diary, "nothing remarkable" occurred during his tenure.<br><br>Nevertheless, secured:<br><br>A Government grant increase (from Rs. 361 to Rs. 700).<br><br>A monthly Railway Company grant (Rs. 75 from 1st January 1914).<br><br>Interned at Khandala during World War I.<br><br>Fr. Trenkamp‚Äôs notes (ending around 1915) record the Church‚Äôs immovable property (1910) as totaling around 16 acres, valued at Rs. 23,456.<br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong><br>The Church at Igatpuri had come a long way from the original two-acre plot acquired for three rupees and two annas.<br>However, a longer path remains ‚Äî perhaps to move onto unbeaten tracks ‚Äî in search of its true Ecclesia.<br><br><strong>(LATER HISTORY)</strong><br>(From Oral Record)<br><br><strong>The Parish Priests who succeeded Fr. Rudden are:</strong><br><br><strong>Fr. E.C. Kieffer</strong> (January 1920 ‚Äì January 1925)<br>Fought a successful battle against the snakes proliferating on the land.<br><br><strong>Fr. F.X. Gallati</strong> (January 1926 ‚Äì October 1926)<br>(No record ‚Äî oral or written.)<br><br><strong>Fr. A. Fortuny</strong> (November 1926 ‚Äì December 1930)<br>(No record.)<br><br><strong>Fr. S.G. Hommel</strong> (1931 ‚Äì March 1939)<br>A mission was preached during his tenure by Frs. Nolan and Sloane.<br><br><strong>Fr. Van Malderen</strong> (October 1939 ‚Äì October 1940)<br>(No record.)<br></p>
